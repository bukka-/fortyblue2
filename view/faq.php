				<h4>What is this?</h4>
				
				<p>I&#39;ve had the idea of a dynamic timetable for a while but never got the time or knowledge to commit myself to such a project. Time and motivation showed up and I was ready to start the first PHP project on my own. I really needed some sort of a project that I did completely alone and open source! I got to learn PHP and make something I would genuinely use. <br> Oh.. and I also happen to use this for my school project.</p>

				<h4>Which tools did you use to build sixtylime?</h4>
				
				<p>sixtylime was built using the MVC pattern with PHP and a lot of JavaScript. Considering the styles, I decided to give Bootstrap a try. For more details you can find the GitHub repository link in the footer. </p>
